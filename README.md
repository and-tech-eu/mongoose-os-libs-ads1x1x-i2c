# ADS1X1X I2C Driver

A Mongoose library for various `I2C` speaking ADCs from Texas Instruments:

*   ADS1115 - 16bit, 860 Samples/sec, 2 differential / 4 single-ended, programmable gain
*   ADS1114 - 16bit, 860 Samples/sec, 1 differential / 1 single-ended, programmable gain
*   ADS1113 - 16bit, 860 Samples/sec, 1 differential / 1 single-ended, no gain
*   ADS1015 - 12bit, 3300 Samples/sec, 2 differential / 4 single-ended, programmable gain
*   ADS1014 - 12bit, 3300 Samples/sec, 1 differential / 1 single-ended, programmable gain
*   ADS1013 - 12bit, 3300 Samples/sec, 1 differential / 1 single-ended, no gain.

The most common are the **ADS1115** and **ADS1015** chips.
